          I work in NLP; at the intersection of language and computer science,
          with applications that support such technologies as automatic translation,
          speech to text transcription, and the information extraction. I am especially interested in language technologies geared towards languages that are typically underrepresented in NLP.

          The languages spoken by humans have latent structures
          that we rely on in order to understand each other, however, it is
          incredibly difficult to identify what those structures are. I have a theoretical background in linguistics, which deals with such topics as categorizing the typological features of languages universally, the study of sound structures, and the nuances of expressing meaning.

          My early career as a software engineer sometimes persists as just a hobby. But it provides me with the tools that I need in order to support so many projects that are driven by my other interests. This entails writing good research code, as well as writing prototypes.
