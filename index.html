          Natural Language Processing

          Machines play an important role so many day-to-day interactions,
          and the ways in which we communicate with them are nuanced to be sure.
          I work in this field at the intersection of language and computer science,
          with applications that support such technologies as automatic translation,
          speech to text transcription, and the extraction of meaning from human speech and text.

          Linguistics

          The complex languages spoken by humans have a latent structure
          that we rely on in order to understand each other, however, it is
          incredibly difficult to identify what those structures are. I have a theoretical background in linguistics, which deals with such topics as categorizing the typological features of languages, universally, the study of sound structures, and the nuances of expressing meaning.

          Web Development

          My professional background in web development sometimes persists as just a hobby. But it provides me with the tools that I need in order to support so many projects that are driven by my other interests. Everybody knows how to navigate a web browser now, and making applications and information accessible over the internet, in a uniform interface is incredibly important.
