      Hey there! I'm Adam. Of all the websites in all the subdomains in the world, you clicked into mine - so thanks for that!

      I recently finished a Master's Degree at CU Boulder in Computational Linguistics. I took the core graduate coursework for both linguistics and Computer Science, and I did a lot of combining the two. I am interested on the one hand in morphology, and especially morphophonology - specifically relating to how morphological systems can be inferred by computers, and what role phonology might play in that. There are some cool things going on in this domain right now, an example of which are the <a href="https://sigmorphon.github.io/sharedtasks/2018/">Sigmorphon shared tasks on reinflection</a>.

      On the other hand, I am interested in meaning representation. Especially approximations of meaning with methods like vector space models. At CU, I worked in a lab on a project called VerbNet, which classifies English verbs into groups based on their shared semantic and syntactic characteristics. This type of work has applications in word sense disambiguation, and I am particularly interested in word representations that can account for such fine-grained differences in meaning.

      Personally, I love to ride my bike, read books, and watch the world cup. I started getting into rock climbing a bit while in Colorado, but have recently moved to baltimore Maryland, where I need to find a place to continue that hobby!
